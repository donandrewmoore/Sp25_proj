In the file, you can expect to find 5 things:

run_mixed_anova.R, cnn_result_agg.csv, cnn_result.csv, survey_analysis_agg.csv, survey_analysis.csv.

run_mixed_anova.R takes cnn_result_agg.csv and survey_analysis_agg.csv and conducts ANOVA analysis. The scatterplots and lineplots I showed in the latex document are also generated by cnn_result_agg.csv and survey_analysis_agg.csv.

The agg.csvs are on agent level. They have four columns, row_index, confidence_mean, accuracy_mean, and dataset (1 out of three possible datasets). It's worth noticing that, although 'row_index' ranges from 0-209, it does NOT suggest a paired relationship. 

The other two csvs are per-question option data. I took a screenshot of ten rows of cnn_result.csv to explain how the data is structured:

- row_index: the i-th agent (cnn or human)
- question_group: this uniquely identifies one of the testing images that an agent sees in a question. For example, dataset=stanford_cars and question_group=28 refers to this image in my Github repo. 
- option: the label options available. In this case, you can see question_group=28 has 5 rows, with the options being Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford.
probs: a confidence score given each option. The probs add up to one given each question_group and agent.
- confidence: the maximum of probs given each question_group. In this case, it's 0.509. It selects 'Audi' as its predicted class.
true_class: the actual label corresponding to the image of the question_group. The mapping is available here. You may verify that 28.jpg of stanford_cars at test is in fact 'BMW'.
- accuracy: an indicator whether predicted class is true class. In this class, it isn't since Audi is not BMW. 

- confidence_mean and accuracy_mean is the average of confidence and accuracy across each agent. This column is the same in the aggregated and disaggreated csvs.
